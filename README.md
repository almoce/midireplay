This application is primarily designed for recording from a MIDI input device and replaying by sending the notes through an output device. It also features the ability to save recorded MIDI note data as a backup in JSON format to a local file, which can be loaded again whenever needed. This app also leverages the localStorage caching feature, which means the last midi data is saved in your browserâ€™s cache system and will remain available even after you close the browser.
